                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <p>When you start learning something new, it's typical to find obstacles along the way. In other words, it's a challenge and you have to choices: avoid it or face it.</p>

                <p>Particularly, Javascript programming is the greatest challenge that I ever faced and currently do.</p>

                <h4>Focus and Humble</h4>
                <p>When you face a challenge and or learn something new, you must take it seriously to succeed. Personally, I keep two things in mind: focus and humbleness. Focus will lead me to do my best to assimilate this overwhelming knowledge. While, humbleness will keep my feet on the ground and continue my never ending learning experience.</p>

                <p>Remember, nobody is born knowing anything. When I get stuck on something, I can't deny that it is frustrating. Then, I am greatful because I am going to learn something new. Let's try to turn the negative into positive. That's a great start into resolving the problem.</p>

                <p>If you don't give up, you never lose. God bless you all!.</p>
